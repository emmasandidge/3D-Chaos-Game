# Applications of 2D and 2D Linear Transformations for Producing Fractals via a Chaos Game
An implementation of the Chaos Game to create 2D and 3D fractals via linear transformations.

The main source code is located here, with the 3D implementation in Python. We also provide 2D examples as a reference via MATLAB code in PDF form.
